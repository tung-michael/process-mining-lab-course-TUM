The log files are taken from [1] and [2]. You can compare your results to the figures contained in [1] and [2] as well as to results produced by existing tools/libraries like ProM, PM4Py, BupaR, ... .
------------------------------------
ALPHA ALGORITHM:
Initial testing:
* L1.xes and L5.xes (indermediate results cf. [1] Chapter 6.2.2), final results Fig.6.1 and Fig.6.8

Further testing:
* L2.xes (Fig.6.2), L3.xes (Fig.6.5), L4.xes (Fig.6.6), running-example.xes (Fig.2.6)
* billinstances.xes (result: "write bill" -> "print bill" -> "deliver bill", cf.[2] Fig.11)
* posterinstances.xes (result: "receive order and photo" -> "design photo poster" -> "print poster" -> "deliver poster", cf.[2] Fig.11)

Testing limitations:
* L6.xes (Fig.6.9), L7.xes (Fig.6.10)
* flyerinstances.xes (result: start -> "receive flyer order" -> "design flyer", "send draft to customer" -> "print flyer" -> "deliver flyer" -> end, cf.[2] Fig.11)
